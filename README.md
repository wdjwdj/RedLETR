REDCAP Load Extract Translate Revise (REDLETR) - Web based tool for importing data into REDCap.

This repository contains the code for the 2014-2015 use case involving the transformation clinical neuropsychology batteries (2010-2014) from various ad hoc solutions to a flexible, centrally-managed, REDCap-backed database. Importantly, this new version contains added features not available in the basic functionality of REDCap such as norm scoring and report generation, facilitating its smooth integration into the clinical workflow.

We have provided our code and documentation as a resource for similar institutions likewise interested in moving clinical research stores to more flexible advanced databases.
